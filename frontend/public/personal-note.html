                <h2>Why this isn't an "About Us" page</h2>
                <p>Almond Spark isn't a company. It's a promise I made to my son to break the wall between us.</p>

                <h2>The problem</h2>
                <p>My non-verbal boy got a school-issued AAC app. It looked like Windows 95 and took ten taps for a simple request. He gave up; I was frustrated.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section class="note-section">
                <h2>The idea</h2>
                <p>When Generative AI hit, I decided to build a cleaner, faster helper. I knew zero Python, but with AI pair-programming and many late nights, "vibe-coding" turned sketches into a working tool.</p>

                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Takes any sentence or concept you wish to convey.</li>
                    <li>breaks it down to atomic concepts and use them to create a four-panel visual strip.</li>
                    <li>Returns a clear PNG you can print, show on a tablet, or stick on the fridge.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="note-limits">Limits: free model quota; heavy use may stall—refresh later.</p>

                <h2>Why not paywall this service?</h2>
                <p>I truly believe in "Tikun Olam" and if even one family gains smoother mornings or calmer bedtimes, my time is paid back. No ads, no subscriptions—just a tiny server bill and a lot of stubborn love.</p>

                <h2>How you can help</h2>

                <h2>BIG DISCLAIMER</h2>
                <p>I built Almond Spark for my own learning and to help my son communicate.
                I make no guarantees—technical, therapeutic, or otherwise.</p>
                <ul class="disclaimer-list">
                    <li>I'm not responsible for what anyone else generates or shows to their kids.</li>
                    <li>The tool may break, vanish, or return content you dislike.</li>
                    <li>Lewd, harmful, or false results are possible. Use at your own risk.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you spot something offensive or broken, email me and I'll try to fix or remove it—but I still can't promise anything.</p>
